abstract: "Temporal action localization (TAL) in videos is a challenging task,
  especially due to the large variation in action temporal scales. Short actions
  usually occupy the major proportion in the data, but have the lowest
  performance with all current methods. In this paper, we confront the challenge
  of short actions and propose a multi-level cross-scale solution dubbed as
  video self-stitching graph network (VSGN). We have two key components in VSGN:
  video self-stitching (VSS) and cross-scale graph pyramid network (xGPN). In
  VSS, we focus on a short period of a video and magnify it along the temporal
  dimension to obtain a larger scale. We stitch the original clip and its
  magnified counterpart in one input sequence to take advantage of the
  complementary properties of both scales. The xGPN component further exploits
  the cross-scale correlations by a pyramid of cross-scale graph networks, each
  containing a hybrid module to aggregate features from across scales as well as
  within the same scale. Our VSGN not only enhances the feature representations,
  but also generates more positive anchors for short actions and more short
  training samples. Experiments demonstrate that VSGN obviously improves the
  localization performance of short actions as well as achieving the
  state-of-the-art overall performance on THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-v1.3."

summary: Short actions are critical and  challenging  in the task of action
  localization. We target this problem and propose a video self-stitching graph
  network (VSGN), which enhances short action  by video self-stitching (VSS) and
  a cross-scale graph pyramid network (xGPN).
