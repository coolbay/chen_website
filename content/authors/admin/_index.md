I am currently Research Scientist at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), and Lead of the Video Group in [Image and Video Understanding Lab (IVUL)](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ivul) with [Prof. Bernard Ghanum](http://www.bernardghanem.com/). I obtained my Ph.D from [Peking University (PKU)](https://english.pku.edu.cn), advised by [Prof. Wen Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b0vWahYAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests focus on image/video understanding (after I got my Ph.D) and image/video compression (during my Ph.D study). I have published 40+ papers on top-tier journals and conference proceedings, such as TPAMI, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV for the field of image/video understanding, and TCSVT, TIP, DCC for the field of image/video compression. I received the Best Paper Candidate in CVPR'22, the Best Paper Award in CVPR'22 workshop, and the Best Paper Award in NCMT'15.
