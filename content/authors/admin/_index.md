I am currently Research Scientist at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), and Lead of the Video Group in [Image and Video Understanding Lab (IVUL)](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ivul) with [Prof. Bernard Ghanum](http://www.bernardghanem.com/). I obtained my Ph.D from [Peking University (PKU)](https://english.pku.edu.cn), advised by [Prof. Wen Gao](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1180/1638.htm) and [Prof. Siwei Ma](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1180/1630.htm). My research interests focus on image/video understanding (after I got my Ph.D) and image/video compression (during my Ph.D study). 

I have published 40+ papers representative journals and conferences in both fields, such as TPAMI, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV in the field of image/video understanding, and TCSVT, TIP, DCC in the field of image/video compression. I received the <span style="color:blue">Best Paper Nomination</span> in CVPR'22, the <span style="color:blue">Best Paper Award</span> in CVPR'23 workshop, and the <span style="color:blue">Best Paper Award</span> in NCMT'15. I have also be awarded the <span style="color:blue">First Prize of Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship Contest (QInF)</span> (only 2 in China), and <span style="color:blue">Goldman Sachs Global Leaders Award</span> (only 26 in the China mainland and 150 worldwide).
